            States with larger populations, like Selangor and Johor, generally have higher GDP growth, while smaller states such as Labuan and Perlis tend to have lower growth. However, exceptions like Sabah, with a large population but low GDP growth, and Putrajaya, with a small population but high GDP growth, show that this is not a strict rule.
            <br>
            Regions with higher populations, such as Selangor, Johor, and Kuala Lumpur, also have higher labor force participation rates, indicating more active labor markets. Conversely, smaller states like Labuan and Perlis have lower participation rates, reflecting less active workforces. Notably, states like Pahang and Selangor, which experience higher GDP growth, tend to have moderate unemployment rates, while lower GDP growth states like Sabah and Sarawak face higher unemployment.

                The visualizations illustrate Malaysia's economic landscape and labor market in 2023. The GDP Annual Growth by Economic Sector graph shows that the Services and Manufacturing sectors significantly contribute to growth, with Services leading in annual percentages. In contrast, the Underemployment in Malaysia by Age Group chart highlights higher underemployment rates among those aged 15-24, indicating job matching challenges for youth. Together, these graphs underscore the need to address underemployment to enhance economic productivity and reflect the ongoing shift toward a service-oriented economy in Malaysia.
