                In 2023, underemployment in Malaysia shows notable differences across age groups. The 25-34 age group experiences the highest rate, with approximately 72,275 individuals underemployed, equating to 12 icons, each representing 6,000 people. The 45+ age group follows with around 47,775 individuals, or 8 icons.

            Larger states like Selangor and Johor tend to have higher GDP growth, while smaller states such as Labuan and Perlis experience lower growth. Exceptions include Sabah, with a large population but low GDP growth, and Putrajaya, with a small population but high GDP growth.
