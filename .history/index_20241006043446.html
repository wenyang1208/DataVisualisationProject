                States with larger populations (such as Selangor and Johor) generally have higher GDP growth rates, though this is not a strict rule (for example, Sabah has a relatively large population but lower GDP growth). Smaller states like Labuan and Perlis tend to have both lower populations and lower GDP growth, except for Putrajaya, which is an outlier with a small population but relatively high GDP growth.
