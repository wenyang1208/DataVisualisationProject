        <div class="annotation" style="top: 60px; left: 345px;">
            <p style="color: black;">In 2023, there were <span style="font-weight: bold">169,800</span> jobless people in Sabah.</p>
        </div>
        <p id="map_text"> Based on the chart, there is significant variation in unemployment rates across the country. Sabah has the highest unemployment rate at 7.525%, followed by Labuan at 6.75%, indicating potential economic challenges in East Malaysia. Terengganu (4.425%) and Kelantan (3.975%) also report relatively high rates compared to other states. 
            <br>
            <br>
            On the lower end, Putrajaya has the lowest unemployment rate at just 0.825%, followed by Pulau Pinang (2.125%) and Perlis (2.175%). States like Johor, Kedah, and Selangor show moderate unemployment rates between 2.4% and 2.45%. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, those unemployed are generally young people, both graduates and non-graduates, who have had trouble entering the job market. Because of this, the Malaysian government is encouraging companies to open up employment opportunities specifically to young adults. The favorable economic climate should help.

            States with larger populations, like Selangor and Johor, generally have higher GDP growth, while smaller states such as Labuan and Perlis tend to have lower growth. However, exceptions like Sabah, with a large population but low GDP growth, and Putrajaya, with a small population but high GDP growth, show that this is not a strict rule.
            <br>
            <br>
            Regions with higher populations, such as Selangor, Johor, and Kuala Lumpur, also have higher labor force participation rates, indicating more active labor markets. Conversely, smaller states like Labuan and Perlis have lower participation rates, reflecting less active workforces. Notably, states like Pahang and Selangor, which experience higher GDP growth, tend to have moderate unemployment rates, while lower GDP growth states like Sabah and Sarawak face higher unemployment.
            <br>
            <br>
            Putrajaya is a standout due to its small population, high GDP growth, strong participation rate, and very low unemployment. Meanwhile, despite Sabah's high participation rate, its elevated unemployment suggests localized economic challenges. High-population states like Selangor and Johor demonstrate economic strength with both high GDP growth and lower unemployment rates.
